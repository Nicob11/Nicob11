### Hi I'm Nico :v:

Full-Stack Junior Developer currently studying at the prestigious
programming school 42 MÃ¡laga.
This school teaches us how the profile of a programmer should be throughout his professional life.
Teamwork, frustration tolerance, continuous learning, and most importantly, to grow professionally while having fun
programming alone and in teams.
I am excited about the idea of contributing my energy and enthusiasm to the company and the team and being able to
continue my personal development and contribute my knowledge.
I hope we can get to know each other!
Thank you!
Enjoy my GitHub profile!
